          One of the rights accorded to the owner of copyright is the right to reproduce or to
          authorize others to reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords. This right is subject to
          certain limitations found in sections 107 through 118 of the copyright law (title 17, U.S.
          Code). One of the more important limitations is the doctrine of “fair use”. The doctrine
          of fair use has developed through a substantial number of court decisions over the years
          and has been codified in section 107 of the copyright law.{'\n\n'}
          Section 107 contains a list of the various purposes for which the reproduction of a
          particular work may be considered fair, such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
          teaching, scholarship, and research. Section 107 also sets out in four factors to be
          considered in determining whether or not a particular use is fair:{'\n\n'} 1. The purpose
          and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for
          nonprofit educational purposes
          {'\n\n'} 2. The nature of the copyrighted work{'\n\n'} 3. The amount and substantiality of
          the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole{'\n\n'}
          4. The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work
